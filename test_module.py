#having a function enclosed in a module is very useful
#we can save an entire thing of code in an alias 
#versus just typing an entire complicated function in your code
#it makes things look nicer
#then you can use the module by importing the name of your module document
#into the new python script by giving it a quick name like "tm"

#defining the module in this document

def hello_world():
	print("Hello world, we made a module")
	
#now open a new script and import the test module. done in "python_use_modules" script
